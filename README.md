# e2eAutomationProjectWithCypress

## 🎯 What is this

This is an end-to-end (E2E) test automation suite built using **Cypress**.  
It covers several interactive modules of the demo web application at (https://playground.bondaracademy.com), including modals/overlays, dynamic dialogs, data tables, form interactions, and other UI flows.  
The goal of this project is to demonstrate modern test automation practices, stable E2E coverage, and reusable test structures — ideal as a portfolio project or baseline for further automation work.

## ✅ What is covered

- Dialogs & overlays (modal windows, random dialogs)  
- Conditional dialog handling (different flows depending on dialog type)  
- Inline editing of data tables (table rows, inline form inputs, save/cancel)  
- Form interaction (inputs, validation, submission)  
- UI state assertions (element visibility, updated content after interactions)  
- Navigation flows — from site landing page through menus to target pages  
- Clean test structure aiming for readability and maintainability
